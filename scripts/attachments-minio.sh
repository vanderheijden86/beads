# attachments-minio.sh -- disposable S3-compatible server for blobstore tests.
#
# MinIO removed minio/minio from Docker Hub and locked quay.io/minio/minio
# behind a paid subscription in September 2026, so no MinIO image can be
# pulled anonymously anymore. This runs Adobe S3Mock instead: an actively
# maintained, MIT-licensed S3 server built for exactly this purpose. The
# script name and BEADS_TEST_S3_ENDPOINT stay as the attachments plan
# specifies them; only the container underneath changed.
#
# `start` runs the server bound to 127.0.0.1:19000 only, waits for its
# health endpoint, and prints the BEADS_TEST_S3_ENDPOINT export the gated
# TestS3StoreContract suite reads. `stop` removes the container; safe to run
# even if it was never started.
#
# Usage:
#   eval "$(scripts/attachments-minio.sh start)"
#   go test ./internal/attachments/blobstore/ -v -timeout 120s
#   scripts/attachments-minio.sh stop
